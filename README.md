## Overview
Pairs trading is a non-directional, relative value investment strategy that does long-short strategies on 2 companies or funds with similar characteristics whose equity securities are currently diverge with the hope of converging. The techniques need to find the diverge or the spread between the two stocks, then does long and short on the underperform and overperform securities respectively.

  Mitigation against systemic risk. Since we are doing both long and short, we are hedged against systemic risk which happened during market collapse.
- Disadvantages: </br>
  It relies heavily on correlation. Thus it is very challenging to identify. Furthermore, sometimes the correlation of the 2 equities breaks, thus the spread are getting bigger. In this scenario, we need to close our position quickly to avoid big losses.
